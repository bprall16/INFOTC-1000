# INFOTC-1000
#### _Welcome to my programming home page_

## This page is to share what understanding and projects I have completed and am capable of with programming.

>Over the course I have worked  to understand the basic knowledge of programming and its uses.  
One of the first projects I have completed is a small [about me](aboutme.py) summary in **Python**. SOme of the Python programming I have been working on includes using the [Turtle](turtleimage.py) in Python for drawing purposes.  An example of one of the more advanced programs is the famous interview program _FizzBuzz_.    
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
<meta charset="UTF-8">  
<title>Fizz Buzz</title>  
<script>  

>function fizzbuzz() {  
	var display = document.getElementById('display');  
	var displayHTML = "";  
	for (i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {  
		var test = "";  
        if (i % 3  == 0 && i % 5 == 0){  
        test += "fizzbuzz"}  
        else if (i % 3 == 0){  
        test += "fizz"}  
        else if (i % 5 == 0){  
        test += "buzz"}  
        else{  
        test += i}  
        displayHTML += "<p>" + test + "</p>";  
	}  
	display.innerHTML = displayHTML  
}  

</script>  

</head>  

<body onload="fizzbuzz()">  
<div id="display">  

</div>  
</body>  

</html>  

Here is a link to the [FIZZBUZZ](FizzBuzz.HTML) programming.  It was created using [IDLE 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
>My previous experience has been with the army as a helicopter repair technician. Currently I am serving with the Missouri National Guard in a new position. If you have questions about the military, you can reach the [Missouri National Guard](https://www.moguard.ngb.mil/) and select contact us.
## Some of the programs I have worked in this semester are:

#### _Welcome to my programming home page_

## This page is to share what understanding and projects I have completed and am capable of with programming.

>Over the course I have worked  to understand the basic knowledge of programming and its uses.  
One of the first projects I have completed is a small [about me]() summary in Python. The most advanced projects inclued the 
famous interview program [FizzBuzz]().  
My pervious experience has been with the army as a helicopter repair technician. Currently I am serving with the Missouri National Guard in a new position. If you have questions about the military, you can reach the [Missouri National Guard](https://www.moguard.ngb.mil/) and select contact us.
